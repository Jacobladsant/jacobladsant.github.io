Portfolio of data analysis projects, including data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and data visualization using tools such as Python (Pandas, Matplotlib), Power BI and Excel.
With a background in Business Administration, my goal is to apply data analysis skills to optimize processes and support strategic decision-making within organizations.
In addition, I have experience in visual and digital design, creating marketing materials, infographics, and UI visuals, with examples such as an e-learning platform interface and infographic design for a hostel, focused on clear communication and user-friendly presentation.
